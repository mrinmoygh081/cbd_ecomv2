    question: "What is CBD?",
    answer:
      "CBD (Cannabidiol) is a natural compound found in the cannabis plant that has potential therapeutic benefits and is non-intoxicating. It is one of over 110 compounds found in the Hemp plant, including others like CBG (Cannabigerol), CBC (Cannabichromene), CBN (Cannabinol) plus Terpenes (Aromatic compounds), and Flavonoids (Flavour compounds).",
  },
  {
    question: "The 3 different types of CBD?",
    answer:
      "There are three main types of CBD: Full-Spectrum, Broad-Spectrum, and CBD Isolate. Full-Spectrum CBD contains all of the compounds found in the Hemp Cannabis plant, including THC. Broad-Spectrum CBD contains all of the compounds except THC. CBD Isolate contains only pure CBD and no other compounds.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is CBD legal?",
    answer:
      "All our CBD Oil Products are 100% UK legal. This is because all our CBD Oils, CBD Pastes, CBD Capsules, CBD Creams and CBD Sweets contain less than 1mg of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), which is the psychoactive compound in cannabis.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is CBD safe?",
    answer:
      "CBD is generally considered extremely safe, with few reported side effects. Some people may experience very mild side effects such as dry mouth and gastrointestinal distress, but this is very rare. If you have any concerns about taking CBD, we recommend talking to a healthcare professional first. Especially if you are taking medications or have any medical conditions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will CBD get me high?",
    answer:
      "Not at all. CBD is made using industrial Hemp and contains very little THC. UK legal CBD products like ours, will not get you high or allow you to fail a drugs test. To ensure complete peace-of-mind, certain people (like athletes, Police, Doctors, Drivers etc), prefer to stick to Isolate CBD as this contains zero THC (the psychoactive compound normally associated with Marijuana).",
